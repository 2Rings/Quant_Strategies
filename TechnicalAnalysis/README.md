## Market Structure

- Market Structure helps you define the current market condition so you know what to do ( to be buying, selling, or staying out of the markets )

### Identify Market Structure


> Area of Value: 
> 1. Support and resistance
>    - Support: An area on your chart where buying pressure could step in
>    - Resistance: An area on your chart where selling pressure could step in
>    - when support is broken, it could become resistance (and vice verse)
> 2. Draw 
>    - Trending Market: Draw the 2 most recent swing point. (No need to look at 3rd previous support at the opposite trend already formed)
>    - Range Market: Draw the highs and lows of the range ( adjust it to get the most number of touches)
